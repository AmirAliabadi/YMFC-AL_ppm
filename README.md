# YMFC-AL with PPM support 
## This is a fork of Joop Brokkings amazing YMFC-AL arduino flight controller

http://www.brokking.net for more info.

I will be updating with the following changes:
* Add PPM input instead of the PWM.  Fewer wires
* Update to use a center postion throttle.


## Full Disclamer:
This is a fork from Joop.  Original ReadMe.txt is included.
